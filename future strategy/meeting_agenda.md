# Meeting Agenda: ABM Methodology Alignment
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes  
**Attendees:** [Student], [Supervisor 1], [Supervisor 2], [Supervisor 3]

## Meeting Goals

1. Acknowledge the feedback constructively
2. Align on realistic scope for revisions
3. Establish better review structure going forward
4. Walk away with concrete next steps

## Agenda

### Part 1: What I've Learned (10 minutes)

**My brief summary:**

"I received feedback that my protocol lacks engagement with ABM validation literature. I've since read Borgonovo et al. (2022) and understand the gaps:

1. Model specification is incomplete - parameters aren't fully documented
2. Sensitivity analysis is insufficient - "two seeds" and vague "exploratory analyses" don't meet field standards
3. Calibration strategy is underdeveloped - just a placeholder

I've created 4 working documents to address these (shared in advance). I'm not presenting these as finished - I need your input to refine them."

**Questions for you:**
- Is my understanding of the issues accurate?
- What did I miss?

---

### Part 2: Scope Reality Check (15 minutes)

**The question:** How much SA is appropriate given my timeline and degree level?

**Options I've outlined:**

**Option A - Minimal but Rigorous:**
- Full calibration + validation
- Parameter screening (top 5 parameters)
- Basic robustness checks
- ~6,000 simulations, ~1 week work
- Supports hypotheses but limited mechanistic insight

**Option B - Standard:**
- Everything in A
- Factorial designs for key hypotheses  
- Visualization of parameter effects
- ~15,000 simulations, ~2 weeks work
- Better understanding of what drives results

**Option C - Comprehensive:**
- Everything in B
- Full variance decomposition
- Non-parametric comparisons
- ~40,000 simulations, ~4 weeks work
- Publication-ready rigor

**I need you to tell me:** Which is realistic for my situation?

**Discussion questions:**
- What's sufficient for [PhD/Master's] thesis?
- Does this affect my overall timeline?
- Are there computational constraints I should know about?

---

### Part 3: What I Need to Know (10 minutes)

**Essential reading I should have had:**

Beyond Borgonovo, what papers constitute "ABM fundamentals" I should have been pointed to?

Please give me 3-5 papers to read **this week** so I can:
- Understand field standards
- See examples of good practice
- Avoid other major gaps

**Suggested structure:**
- [ABM Supervisor]: Recommend 2-3 ABM methodology papers
- [Stats Supervisor]: Recommend 1-2 validation/comparison papers  
- [Domain Supervisor]: Recommend 1 paper showing ABM in our field

---

### Part 4: Better Supervision Structure (15 minutes)

**The problem:** Knowledge mismatch + late-stage feedback = inefficient

**Proposed solution:** Staged checkpoints with designated reviewers

| Checkpoint | What's Reviewed | Primary Reviewer | Timeline |
|------------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| 1. Model Spec | Definitions, equations, rules | [ABM supervisor] | Week 2 |
| 2. Pilot Results | Does it work? Sensible outputs? | [ABM supervisor] | Week 4 |
| 3. SA Protocol | Scope, methods, feasibility | Full team | Week 5 |
| 4. Results | Standard review | Full team | Week 10+ |

**Benefits:**
- Catches problems early
- I get expert feedback when I need it
- Less work for everyone (focused 30-min reviews vs. full rewrites)

**Questions:**
- Does this structure work for your schedules?
- Should we adjust frequency or format?
- Other suggestions?

---

### Part 5: Immediate Next Steps (10 minutes)

**Agreement on:**

**This week:**
- [ ] I'll read the recommended papers
- [ ] I'll complete model specification document
- [ ] [ABM supervisor] will review model spec (30 min session)

**Next 2 weeks:**
- [ ] I'll implement pilot SA (agreed scope)
- [ ] I'll run test simulations
- [ ] We'll have Checkpoint 2 meeting

**Within 4 weeks:**
- [ ] Full team reviews SA protocol (Checkpoint 3)
- [ ] We approve final scope before major computation
- [ ] Clear timeline to completion

**Who does what:**
- [ABM supervisor]: Primary technical reviewer, bi-weekly 30-min check-ins
- [Stats supervisor]: Review error metrics and comparison approach
- [Domain supervisor]: Review interpretation and research questions
- [Student]: Provide updates weekly, flag blockers immediately

## Materials to Review Before Meeting

*(I shared these in advance - no need to read deeply, but skim for context)*

1. Model Elements Chart - template for documenting parameters/rules
2. Sensitivity Analysis Framework - proposed SA protocol
3. Calibration Strategy - three-stage process
4. Protocol Revision Checklist - timeline and priorities

---

## My Asks

**In this meeting:**
1. Choose Option A, B, or C for SA scope
2. Get the essential reading list
3. Approve checkpoint structure (or propose alternative)
4. Schedule next review session

**Going forward:**
5. Clearer expectations about what I should know vs. what you'll teach me
6. Earlier feedback on technical methodology before deep implementation
7. Designated points of contact for different methodology areas

---

## What I'm Committing To

- I'll read the recommended papers immediately
- I'll use checkpoints properly - no moving forward without approval
- I'll document everything clearly for review
- I'll ask when I'm stuck instead of guessing
- I'll be realistic about what's feasible

---

## Parking Lot

*(Questions that aren't urgent but should be addressed eventually)*

- Should we establish a regular ABM methodology reading group?
- Are there workshops/courses I should take?
- How do we prevent this situation for future students?

---

## Expected Outcomes

**By end of meeting, we should have:**
- ✓ Agreed SA scope (A, B, or C)
- ✓ Essential reading list (3-5 papers)
- ✓ Approved checkpoint structure
- ✓ Scheduled Checkpoint 1 review
- ✓ Clear next steps for everyone

**If we can't decide on something:** That's okay - we'll note it and schedule a follow-up
